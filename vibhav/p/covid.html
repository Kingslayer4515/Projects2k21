            Covid -19 has affected the whole world and it has become really tough to control the outspread of the virus. Keeping the present scenario in mind, we have made a project that can be proved helpful in tackling this situation.Our project is an Automatic Device used to detect mask ,measure the human body temperature and sanitize hands.This project will reduce the contact as well as extra labour needed for the whole process. The main benefit of the project is that it reduces the contact needed for checking the temperature of the person as it will replace the person with a machine. Also,it can perform multiple operations that makes it cost efficient at the present pandemic conditions.The technologies used are OpenCV, Internet of things and Machine Learning . The project is made using Proteus  8.0 Professional software. The hardware components used for the project are Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi,Passive infrared sensor,
            Temperature sensor MLX90614. This project has an approximate cost of Rs. 4500-4600 that makes it affordable and beneficial for the users.

            This device can be used at the entrance of crowded  places such as malls, offices, shops, stadiums, hospitals, markets, bus terminals, restaurants, and other public gatherings . This device will be really useful for today's world due to this pandemic situation and will surely help in fighting against the virus.
