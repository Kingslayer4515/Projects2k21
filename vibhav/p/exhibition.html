          Due to the pandemic situation conducting an exhibition was a tedious task. To get through this problem we have
          created a project namely E-Exhibition.This project consists of a virtual environment with 3D models of
          numerous projects which solves the problem of conducting exhibition virtually.The sole reason for developing
          this project is to showcase many other projects made with excruciating efforts by creating their 3D Models so
          that it can be seen anywhere by anyone.

          Technical points: The project has been made by using open-source softwares like Blender, Unity and Vs Code
          which contributes to itâ€™s zero cost. Blender has been used to create 3D models of project.Then the environment
          of the exhibition hall in Unity. Also the projects involve use of Natural Language Processing for creating an
          interactive bot to resolve the queries.

          Execution: We have made an app where we added a question answering bot to the project that'll answer the
          user's queries regarding the project and their are 3D models of those projects. In this app we can see buttons
          for different projects and by clicking on them it will lead the user to that project environment where we can
          see the model of the project and its details.

          Merits: The project is made upon zero cost. Also it can be used as an art exhibition. The project also saves
          space and time by creating a virtual environment.
